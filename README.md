-Background
You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

-Analysis 
Your analysis here: Based off this data, Charter schools tend to perfrom much better than district schools. The data also reveals that small and medium sized schools perform better than larger schools. This is most likely because of teacher to student ratios being smaller which allows students to get more Individualized attention. While budget plays a small part in how scores may differ, size seems to be a bigger factor.
Some important findings:

Cabrera High School Charter 1858, has a lower budget per student at $582.00 but has the highest passing scores. Small school size of less than 1,000 students has the highest passing scores.
